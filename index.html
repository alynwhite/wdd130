            <p>Hi, I am Alexia White. I am very rusty with using html. I am excited to be learning the basics of html as well as good practices for web development. I am from a small town in Utah, USA. I am the fourth child out of six. I like to say I am the oldest of the youngest. I love being with my family. If I could go on anysort of trip, I would want to travel the world and taste and learn all sorts of foods. I would start in France to learn about pastries. </p>

            <p>North, centeral Utah is a bustling place. You have Salt Lake City and all of the surrounding cities around it. If you follow the Interstate 15 from the north to the south you will see a decrease in the sizes of towns. You can hit St. George and that will be the biggest city of southern Utah. Utah is a state that has a lot of federal land which means there are so many places for the public to visit. You can go from the green mountains in Northern Utah to a dry desert in southern Utah all in a days travel. </p>
