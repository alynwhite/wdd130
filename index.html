            <p>Hi, I am Alexia White. I am very rusty with using html. I am excited to be learning the basics of html as well as good practices for web development. I am from a small town in Utah, USA. I am the fourth child out of six. I like to say I am the oldest of the youngest. I love being with my family. If I could go on anysort of trip, I would want to travel the world and taste and learn all sorts of foods. I would start in France to learn about pastries. </p>
